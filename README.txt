This is a plugin for Textpattern built by Walker Hamilton (http://walkerhamilton.com) that enables the use of RSSCloud. Portions of this plugin are based on the plugin initially implemented by Joseph Scott (http://josephscott.org/). You should really use PubSubHubBub and not RSSCloud, but, since Worpress had this thing running, I figured Textpattern should have the ability too.

To install, grab the current version of the compressed plugin (wlk_rsscloud.txt) and paste into the plugin field in Textpattern.

As long as it's been installed & activated, you're ready to go.

This has been tested with 4.2.0 only. It requires CURL.
